# Scripting in bash and Python

All scripts should be written in a way that takes into account several factors:

1. Use the shebang / make the script executable
2. Error out gracefully --> set -e / error codes --> || exit 1;
3. Use input parameters
4. Conditional logic
5. Environment / full paths / env variables
6. Logging
7. Use comments

## bash

### shebang
A well-formatted `bash` script begins with a "shebang" line:
```
#!/bin/bash
```
that points to the full path of the `bash` shell. This may differ from one environment
to the next.

To make any bit of code executable, use `chmod 755` against it.

### Use full paths

Any binary executables used in a shell script should be invoked using their full
paths. This is to avoid any ambiguity and preempt any errors of a shell not being
able to find the command.

For example, when invoking the `aws` command-line in a script you would normally call
```
/usr/local/bin/aws
```
To determine the full path of an executable in a given system, use the `which` command:
```
which aws
```

### Graceful Errors

In most `bash` shell scripts you may `set -e` near the head of the script. This flag
tells the script that, upon any error, it should escape/exit the script and stop running.
This is important since to proceed past an error may produce very bad results or
unintended consequences.

Another option is to use conditional, such that when a specific line of the script
fails to execute, the failed line can `exit` with a non-zero code. This can be a useful
output for debugging

### Sleep

If you need a deliberate pause in the middle of a script, simply `sleep 5` for a 5-second
pause, etc. This may be especially useful in the midst of `try` logic.

### Input parameters

Remember that `$0`, `$1`, `$2`, etc. are reserved parameters `bash` understands as positional
arguments when invoking from the command-line:

- `$0` is the invoking script itself
- `$1` is the first parameter after the script name
- `$2` is the second parameter ...
- . . .

`positional-args.sh`
```
#!/bin/bash

echo "$0 <-- invoking script"
echo "$1 <-- first parameter"
echo "$2 <-- second parameter"
```
returns the following output:

```
$ ./positional-args.sh bananas blueberries

./positional-args.sh <-- invoking script
bananas <-- first parameter
blueberries <-- second parameter
```


### If/Else conditional logic:

Start your `if` with a comparison, end with `fi`.

```bash
if [[ $VAR -gt 10 ]]
then
  echo "That number is greater than 10."
else
  echo "Your number is pretty small!"
  exit 0;
fi
```

### Environment

`env` gives you all environment variables for your session. This may vary
for an unattended script (without you around).

Add environment variables in `bash`:
```
export VARIABLE=value-of-variable
```

Use full paths to your binaries to avoid your unattended script being unable
to locate a binary. Just because you can run it by hand does not mean it can
run without you around.

### Logging

A simple-yet-valuable step in your scripting is to log. You can log every action
taken by the script, or limit logging to successes or failures.

A common format for logging might be a snippet like this:

```
# First establish the datetime:
NOW=$(date +"%m-%d-%Y-%H:%M:%S")
echo $NOW " OK - Successfully processed " $FILENAME >> /var/log/output.log
```
The result would be a single file building with each row as it is logged.
Note the `>>` to append to a file instead of overwriting it!

### Comment

One of the most useful habits you can develop as a programmer is adding comments
to your code. This explains each chunk of code but might also justify why a particular
choice has been made. This will be invaluable to you, when you come back to the code
two years later, or when your code is shared with others.

## Python

Scripting in `python` is fairly similar, but it has a lot more functionality in 
terms of libraries, classes, functions, etc. A few things to note:

- Unlike `bash` it is not as easy to pass `$1`, `$2` parameters in the command-line.
Refer to [Command line arguments in Python](https://stackabuse.com/command-line-arguments-in-python/) for a basic tutorial.
- Python can invoke shell scripts in other languages.
- Python has many better options for conditional logic, error handling, and logging.
- Whereas `bash` and other low-level tools (`grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `tr`, `perl`, etc.) can parse 
plain-text "flat" files fairly efficiently, Python can ingest a data file and load it 
into memory for much more complex transformations. A library like `pandas` can use 
dataframes like a staging database for you to query, scan, count, etc. Here's a great [pandas
tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/tutorial-accessing-data-with-pandas) on Kaggle.


### Starting JupyterLab in Codespaces

JupyterLab is pre-installed in your codespace environment. To start it:

1. Open a terminal in your VSCode codespace (Terminal → New Terminal)
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab --allow-root
   ```
3. The terminal will display a URL with an authentication token. Look for a line like:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=...
   ```
   Copy the token info *after* the "...token=". We'll need it in the next step.

4. In VS Code, you should see a notification asking if you want to open the forwarded port, or you can:
   - Click on the "Ports" tab in the bottom panel
   - Find port 8888 in the list
   - Click the "Open in Browser" icon (globe icon) next to port 8888
5. JupyterLab will open in a new browser tab. Enter the token (from step 3) into the authentication field when prompted.

**Note:** Port 8888 is automatically forwarded in Codespaces, so you don't need to manually configure port forwarding.

Alternatively you can set up the software environment locally on your own computer, see [SETUP_LOCAL.md](SETUP_LOCAL.md) 

### Running a Python script

1. Open a terminal window.
2. In the terminal run:
    ```bash
    python my_script.py # add command line args as needed if the script is written to handle them.
    ```

## Hands-On Practice

1. Write a primary script in `bash` that does two things:
  - Invokes a `bash` script to retrieve the log file found in `retrieve_file.sh`.
  - Invokes a `python3` script to parse that file and write the output

2. Want a more challenging assignment? Write a `python` script that does both tasks.
